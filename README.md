# React + TypeScript + Vite



This code was a challenge to see how much of a front end site I could complete within 4 hours, starting from scratch with no skeleton code. 

To run this project run:


```
npm run dev
````


Things I would do differently with more time

- Separate all common functions into one place or separate files
- Cutomize styling of messages
- Created separate message object for MessageThread and conversation since they have different style requirements and use cases
- Encrypt any passing of tokens
- Add tests
- Add integration tests
- Ensure token is refreshed if it expires before making any new api calls
- Sanitize message inputs and validate inputs before making api calls
- Add onHover to message cards in the Conversations component
- Remove all ues of 'any' keyword was short on time
- Sort all messages by proper order
- More which I will reflect on before the debrief! :D
